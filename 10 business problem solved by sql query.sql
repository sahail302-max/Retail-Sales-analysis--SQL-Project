-- My Analysis & Findings
-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date ='2022-11-05';


-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Clothing'
AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')='2022-11'
AND quantity>=4


-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
SELECT category,SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category


-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
SELECT category,ROUND(AVG(age),2)
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Beauty'
GROUP BY category;


-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale>1000


-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
SELECT category,gender,COUNT(*) AS total_trans 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category,gender
ORDER BY category,total_trans DESC;


-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
SELECT years,months,avg_sale
FROM
(
SELECT  
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS years,
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS months,
	AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS RANKS
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY years,months
) AS t1
WHERE RANKS=1
-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
SELECT customer_id,SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id 
LIMIT 5;


-- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
SELECT category,COUNT(customer_id) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category


-- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
WITH hourly_sales
AS(
SELECT *,
	CASE
	   WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time)<=12 THEN 'Morning'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
	   ELSE 'Evening'
	 END AS shift
